Last week was a short week for Thanksgiving, but somewhat eventful.

- `~battus-datsun` revised [roadmap.urbit.org](https://roadmap.urbit.org).  It's organized much better now, in my opinion.
- `~wicdev-wisryt`'s [upgrade overhaul](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/agents-in-clay) made its way into Tlon's devstream process and is now running on many Tlon ships.  It's exciting to see this.  The new upgrade system is much cleaner and easier to reason about than the old one.
- `~palfun-foslup` tweaked his [userspace permissioning](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/userspace-permissioning) work to prevent a certain kind of confused deputy attack, which had come up in conversation with `~tondes-sitrym` about his urbit Lightning wallet architecture.
- [Vere 1.13 was released](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/tag/urbit-v1.13), the third runtime release within just a couple of weeks.  This one bumped up the maximum loom size from 2GB to 4GB, which brought joy to the people.  [An 8GB loom is now in testing](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6077).
- `~norsyr-torryn` fixed [a couple](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6076) of [bugs in Ames](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6102).
- `~tinnus-napbus` and `~dinleb-rambep` made progress on [shims for
  userspace Kelvins](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/shims-old-kelvins), including getting Clay to search its commit history to find an old Kelvin version, build the standard library for that Kelvin, and cache it to make sure it's deduplicated across desks.  Their work can be tracked in this [draft PR](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6104).  A cool Hoon trick, which I hadn't seen before, can be found [here](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6104/files#diff-1439e4e22657662d922c2fb3a63e6455b62e8222018d31431b833c4f92274dc7R1474).
- I learned more from `~master-morzod` about Hoon's compile-time evaluator, and wrote a [github comment about it](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/5541#issuecomment-1330026666).  That code could use a style cleanup -- it's so sparse that it's hard to read.
- We had some interesting discussions about the remote scry protocol and its implications for solid-state subscriptions.  `~master-morzod` made two salient points:
  - An intermediate point in the design space for solid-state subscriptions, to be used as a placeholder if we have remote scry but not a `%pine` protocol for querying at latest (or just if we want to avoid using `%pine` more than needed), is to use Ames for notifying subscribers that a "rock" (snapshot) has been deleted and replaced with a new rock, and use remote scry for everything else.  If a subscriber knows it will be notified when a rock gets deleted, it doesn't have to try to resubscribe heuristically -- it can just blithely keep asking for the next diff ("wave") until it's told about the new rock and learns it needs to resubscribe.
  - Ideally we wouldn't need any sessions, in the sense that Van Jacobson calls "conversations": two-party communication.  Jacobson's Named Data Networking, the inspiration for the remote scry protocol, avoids conversations entirely, based on the observation that data dissemination is almost always one-to-many; data should be able to diffuse across a network.

  I've thought for a while that we'll need [network sessions](https://roadmap.urbit.org/future#urth-to-urth) to ensure low latency for responses to scry requests for data that doesn't exist yet, but I thought of an alternative: ["sticky scry requests"](https://gist.github.com/belisarius222/f020026841048a135b6288d724e57b20).  If this works, we could avoid building the session protocol, meaning we could start using remote scry for app data sooner than I'd thought -- we'd just need sticky scry and [encrypted remote scry](https://roadmap.urbit.org/project/encrypted-remote-scry).
