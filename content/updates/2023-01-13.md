Since the start of the new year, some releases have gone out.  We just updated the roadmap to reflect the recently completed projects, and some other projects got shuffled a bit.  Expect a big release on Tuesday that includes `~palfun-foslup`'s improvements to Urbit's terminal.  This is an exciting, long-anticipated release.

Work continues to progress on several fronts, including solid-state subscriptions, the 8GB loom, Ames bug fixing, and Kelvin shims to build and run old userspace code.  Urbit Foundation will be continuing to take on more responsibility for core development, including more integration with the release process.

`~sarpen-laplux` had some interesting ideas about the Hoon type system, which he published in the "core" channel of the `~middev/the-forge` group on Urbit.  I also wrote up a [proposal for a "theory of everything" of Urbit networking](https://gist.github.com/belisarius222/7f8452bfea9b199c0ed717ab1778f35b), based largely on an earlier proposal from `~ritpub-sipsyl`, linked in the document.
