## Summary

Clearing the backlog of projects waiting to be released is the team's main goal for the next few months.  Many of the other current projects, such as logging, Vere build system improvements, and userspace Kelvin shims, should increase release cadence in the future.

The highest-priority project being worked on currently is the "agents-in-clay" work, which replaces the system the kernel uses to upgrade itself -- the new system is much simpler and more reliable.  Once this is released, releasing other code will be less risky and can proceed faster.

Along with process-oriented changes, work is also proceeding on projects relating to other goals: userspace permissions will be a major step forward in security, and the New Mars and solid-state publications projects are essential for network scaling.
