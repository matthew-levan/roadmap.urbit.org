A number of projects are slated to be worked on or released soon.  Some of these, such as `~palfun-foslup`'s terminal work and the remote scry protocol, are in the backlog -- done or mostly done, but blocked from release due to other releases needing to go out first.  Addressing this backlog is high priority.

Other items in this listing are not yet done but are planned as immediate next steps, such as jet dashboard research and breadth-first Arvo move order.
