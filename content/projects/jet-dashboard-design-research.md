Urbit's jet dashboard (the code in the runtime that identifies Nock code that has equivalent C code that can be run instead) is quite complex and not as fast as we'd like it to be.

There are a lot of potential ways a jet dashboard could work.  Experimenting with different designs, even just as proofs of concept in Hoon, will help us reduce runtime complexity and increase performance.  Since the jet dashboard is also one of Urbit's security attack surfaces, simplifying it should make the system more secure.
