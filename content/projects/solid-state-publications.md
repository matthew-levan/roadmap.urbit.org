For scalability, basic solid-state publications are being prototyped.  This is the next step after basic remote scry toward scalable data publishing on Urbit.  These prototypes live in userspace; once we've proven the model with some real-world examples, we can build kernel support into Gall.

This is part of the [subscription reform](https://gist.github.com/belisarius222/0b53d59014a0a1b507363474a2dbe0ae) project.
