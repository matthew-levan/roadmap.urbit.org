Urbit emits no log messages, making debugging and telemetry much more difficult.  Adding a basic logging system to Urbit (probably logging to files as a first step, or maybe syslog) would reduce hosting costs, improve release cycle times, and reduce the amount of time it takes devs to debug live ships.
